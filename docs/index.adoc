Traditionally, the game is played using:

* *a decoding board*, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes,
  and twelve additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes
* *code pegs* of six different colours, which will be placed in the large holes on the board
* small *key pegs*, some coloured black, some white, which will be placed in the small holes on the board

In the conventional Mastermind game there are two players:

* *CodeMaker* - chooses a pattern of four code pegs and places them in the four holes covered by the shield.
  This secret code is only visible to the CodeMaker.
* *CodeBreaker* - tries to guess the secret code withing twelve turns, in both order and colour.
  Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
  Once placed, the CodeMaker provides feedback by placing zero to four key pegs in the small holes
  of the row with the guess.

Feedback is provided with key pegs:

* a **black key peg** is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both colour and position
* a **white key peg** is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in colour but in a wrong position
* if there are duplicate colours in the guess, they can only be awarded a key peg
  if they correspond to the same number of duplicate colours in the secret code
