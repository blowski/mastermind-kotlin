= Quality Attributes

Since this is a pet project the expectations below are mostly made up.

== Performance

* The system needs to handle 1,000 simultaneous games every hour for consecutive 8hrs.

== Scalability

* The system needs to cope with 10,000 games a day for the next 5 years.

== Availability

* The game should be available to the end users 24x7.
* Occasional downtime of less than 1hr a week can be tolerated.

== Failover

== Security

* The game should be anonymous and open to everyone.

== Audit

* The following events must be recorded in the system audit log:
** Game started
** Move Made
** Game Won
** Game Lost

== Fault tolerance and resilience

* All errors should be logged.

== Internationalization and localization

* all user interfaces, messages, and communication should be English only

== Monitoring and management

* an e-mail notification should be sent in case:

** a system healthcheck fails

== Data retention and archiving
