= 3. Choose the database software

Date: 2020-01-23

== Status

Accepted

== Context

The application needs two types of persistence:

* event store - to persist the stream of events
* view store - to persist views generated by projections

vlingo supports many popular database systems via its JDBC driver.
Some database systems got its dedicated driver.

== Decision

PostgreSQL will be used for both stores as it's a popular, easy to set up,
and efficient database system that the team has experience with.

== Consequences

As a consequence the project can be started quickly, with PostgreSQL running in a docker container.
Shall the need ever arise, the decision can be revisited at a later stage to
migrate one of the stores to a different system.
