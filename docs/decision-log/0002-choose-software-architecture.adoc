= 2. Choose software architecture

Date: 2020-01-23

== Status

Accepted

== Context

The sole purpose of this project is to practice CQRS and Event Souring with the
https://docs.vlingo.io/vlingo-lattice/entity-cqrs:vlingo/lattice library.

== Decision

By definition this project has to use event sourcing.

== Consequences

Software architecture of the project will follow what vlingo's documentation and examples
demonstrate. Decoupling from vlingo is not going to be the focus at this point.
