= Functional Overview

The Mastermind software is a single player code-breaking game.
This is different to the classic Mastermind which is a two player game.
In the digitalised version the CodeMaker player is replaced by the system.

In the game of Mastermind, the CodeBreaker has the capability to:

* *Start a new game* - a new secret code is randomly generated each time the game is started.
* *Make a guess* - CodeBreaker has a number of attempts to break the code. Feedback is given on each attempt.
